  "body": "[Julia](http://julialang.org/) is a programming language created by [Jeff Bezanson](https://github.com/JeffBezanson), [Alan Edelman](http://www-math.mit.edu/~edelman), [Stefan Karpinski](http://karpinski.org/), and [Viral B. Shah](https://github.com/viralbshah) in 2009. First released to the public in 2012, Julia has since become the product of hundreds of developers across the globe.\r\n\r\nToday, a small group of researchers reside at MIT and focus on theoretical and numerical aspects of the core Julia language, base library, and several other packages. Current activities center around data science applications, numerical linear algebra, parallel computing, and type theory.\r\n\r\nCurrent members\r\nDr. Jiahao Chen, Research Scientist\r\n\r\nProf. Alan Edelman, Principal Investigator\r\n\r\nProf. David P.
