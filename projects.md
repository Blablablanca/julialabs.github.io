### Accelerate learning by automatically reducing the size of the training dataset.

Feasibility study on reducing the size of an a-HfO2 dataset using a parallel method based on HDBSCAN and ACE. A parallel Julia implementation of a state of the art method will be required as well as the proposal of an improved version aligned to [CESMIX](https://computing.mit.edu/cesmix/) objectives.
