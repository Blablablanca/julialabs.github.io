# Projects (MEng/UROP)

If you are interested in any of these projects and are a current MIT student looking for a UROP or MEng please reach out
to the mentor listed next to project.

## Julia Compiler/Runtime for HPC
Mentor: Valentin Churavy

We have many projects for working on compiler or runtimes in the context of scientific computing, the topics below can
serve as inspiration.


### Accelerated computing

- Caching for GPU compilation
- 

#### KernelAbstractions.jl
#### AMDGPU.jl
Mentor: Julian Samaroo

### Compiler based automatic-differentiation -- Enzyme.jl

[Enzyme.jl](https://github.com/EnzymeAD/Enzyme.jl) is the Julia frontend to the Enzyme automatic-differentiation engine.

- Improved JIT compilation for Enzyme
  - Compile on Demand / Parallel JIT
  - Caching of Enzyme AD results
  - Caching of inference results for reducing inital latency 
- 

### General Julia compiler infrastructure

- Better native debug-information (DWARF).
- Debug-information on demand.
- Exploring profile-guided optimization

## CESMIX

### Accelerate learning by automatically reducing the size of the training dataset.

Feasibility study on reducing the size of an a-HfO2 dataset using a parallel method based on HDBSCAN and ACE. A parallel Julia implementation of a state of the art method will be required as well as the proposal of an improved version aligned to [CESMIX](https://computing.mit.edu/cesmix/) objectives.
